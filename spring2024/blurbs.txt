Andy Huang
Andy Huang is an MIT alum who learned how to figure skate here at this rink with the MIT figure skating club. This program is dedicated to his mom, who passed away from breast cancer ten years ago. She was the kindest, most wonderful person in the world, someone whom Andy learned so much from. He feels so lucky to have had her as his mom, and is so grateful for all the years that they were able to share together.
